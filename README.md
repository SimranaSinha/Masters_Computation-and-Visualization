# Assignment 2: Data Visualization Project: Analyzing the U.S. Housing Market Using Time Series Data

Objective:
Analyze trends in the U.S. housing market over time using time series data. The goal is to help students understand long-term trends, cyclical patterns, and potential impacts of economic events on the housing market. Students will focus on creating insightful time series visualizations to explore key metrics such as home prices, sales volume, mortgage rates, and housing inventory.

Project Instructions:
Data Collection: Obtain housing market time series data from reliable sources such as:

Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) for housing prices, mortgage rates, and housing inventory.
Zillow Research for housing price index and rental data.
U.S. Census Bureau for new residential sales and construction data.
Examples of relevant time series data include:

Median Home Prices: Monthly or quarterly average home prices across different regions.
Housing Sales Volume: Number of homes sold over time (e.g., monthly or quarterly).
Mortgage Interest Rates: Average mortgage rates for 30-year fixed loans over time.
Housing Inventory: Available housing stock for sale or rent over time.
Choose Metrics to Analyze: Select at least three different time series metrics to analyze. You can choose from the following:

Median home prices (nationally or regionally).
Housing sales volume (number of units sold).
Mortgage interest rates.
Housing inventory or vacancy rates.
New construction starts or permits issued.
Time Period: Focus on analyzing data over a minimum of 10 years to identify long-term trends. You may also include more specific time periods such as the 2008 housing crisis, the post-pandemic housing boom, or recent fluctuations in mortgage rates.

Visualizations:  
a. Line Charts (for each time series)
Create individual line charts for each of your selected metrics, highlighting their trends over time. Be sure to clearly label axes and include important data points, such as notable economic events (e.g., the 2008 housing crash, the 2020 pandemic impact).

b. Annotations and Trendlines
Add annotations or trendlines to mark significant shifts, recessions, or policy changes that influenced the housing market.

Analysis Questions:  
What are the key trends in home prices, sales, and mortgage rates over time?
How do different metrics relate to each other (e.g., how do changes in mortgage rates affect home sales)?
Can you identify any cyclical patterns or seasonality in the data?
How did significant economic events (e.g., the 2008 financial crisis or COVID-19 pandemic) affect the housing market?

Tools: Use any data visualization tool of your choice, such as:  
Python: (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
R: (ggplot2)
Excel
Tableau or Power BI

Deliverables:  
Report (400-500 words): Analyzing the trends observed in the visualizations, interpreting the relationships between different variables, and explaining how economic events impacted the housing 



# Project 1 : Data Visualization Project on Work-from-Home vs. Back-to-Office Policies

This project focuses on an analysis of work-from-home (WFH) vs. back-to-office policies, utilizing insights from the WFH Research database. The goal is to provide a clear, data-driven view on the impacts of these policies across different industries and regions, helping us assess their long-term implications. In addition to the source mentioned here you are encouraged to use other relevant data sources on WFH.

This project will require gathering data, performing a comprehensive analysis, and creating compelling visualizations that effectively communicate key trends, benefits, and challenges associated with each work model. You have the flexibility to shape the analysis based on your findings, either supporting WFH or advocating for back-to-office policies.

Key Project Deliverables:
- Data Analysis: A thorough analysis of the WFH Research data to understand patterns, productivity metrics, employee satisfaction, and cost-efficiency.
- Visualizations: Graphs, charts, or interactive dashboards that clearly represent your findings.
- Report: A concise report summarizing the insights, supported by visual evidence.


# Makeup Assignment : Analyzing USA Imports and Exports in 2021
Objective: Explore and visualize data on USA imports and exports to understand trade flows, key product categories, major trading partners

Project Tasks:

Data Collection:
- Find and download USA imports and exports data for 2021.

Interpretation:
- Key Partners: Discuss which trading partners are most significant and how they differ for imports and exports.
- Product Categories: Explain the significance of specific product categories in trade and what this may indicate about the USA's economic priorities.
Report (500 words):

Summarize insights and include visuals.
Describe key findings and how different visualizations helped illustrate various aspects of USA trade data.

# Assignment 3: Patent across different Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) in the United States
Objective
Create a choropleth map to visualize the distribution of patents across different Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) in the United States. The goal is to identify regions with high patent activity

Instructions
Data Preparation:

Download a dataset containing the number of patents issued, categorized by MSA.
Since patents are awarded every year select one year of data.
Include all product classes, i.e., total number of patents from an area for that year
Setup:

Use Python/ R/ datawrapper/ tableau/flourish (or any other tool) to generate the choropleth map.
Recommended Python libraries: pandas, geopandas, matplotlib, plotly, folium.
Recommended R libraries: ggplot2, sf, leaflet.
Enhance Your Map:

Add labels for MSAs with the top 5 highest patent counts.
Analysis:

Create a visualization webpage (200–300 words) summarizing:
Regional trends in patent distribution.

# Project 2: Regional data based on zip code

For Project 2, you will create a data visualization dashboard that analyzes various regional data based on zip codes (Select a state and a county of your choice). The goal is to assign a comprehensive score to each zip code based on the variables you collect and analyze. Below are the key requirements and instructions for the project.

Project Requirements:
Data Collection:

You must collect at least five different variables for each zip code. These could include factors such as population density, median income, crime rates, education levels, housing prices, or access to public services.
All data must be sourced from credible and publicly available databases (e.g., government websites, census data, etc.).
Proper citations are required for each data source used. Ensure you provide a reference in APA format for each data set on the dashboard or in an accompanying document.
Score Calculation:

Use the data to create a composite score for each zip code, which reflects the region’s overall desirability or suitability based on the chosen variables.
Clearly explain the weighting system and methodology for how each variable contributes to the overall score. This explanation should either be included on the dashboard or in a brief written summary.
Dashboard Visualization:

Your dashboard should display the following key components:
Map Visualization of zip codes with color-coding based on the scores.
Variable-specific Charts/Graphs (e.g., bar charts for income levels, heatmaps for population density).
Score Breakdown: An interactive table or chart that breaks down the score for each zip code by the variables chosen.
The dashboard should be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing viewers to interact with and explore the data.
Data Citation:

Include a section on the dashboard or an accompanying document where each data source is properly cited.
Use APA format for citing the data sources (e.g., “U.S. Census Bureau. (2023). Population by Zip Code. Retrieved from…”).
