# Assignment 2: Data Visualization Project: Analyzing the U.S. Housing Market Using Time Series Data

Objective:
Analyze trends in the U.S. housing market over time using time series data. The goal is to help students understand long-term trends, cyclical patterns, and potential impacts of economic events on the housing market. Students will focus on creating insightful time series visualizations to explore key metrics such as home prices, sales volume, mortgage rates, and housing inventory.

Project Instructions:
Data Collection: Obtain housing market time series data from reliable sources such as:

Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) for housing prices, mortgage rates, and housing inventory.
Zillow Research for housing price index and rental data.
U.S. Census Bureau for new residential sales and construction data.
Examples of relevant time series data include:

Median Home Prices: Monthly or quarterly average home prices across different regions.
Housing Sales Volume: Number of homes sold over time (e.g., monthly or quarterly).
Mortgage Interest Rates: Average mortgage rates for 30-year fixed loans over time.
Housing Inventory: Available housing stock for sale or rent over time.
Choose Metrics to Analyze: Select at least three different time series metrics to analyze. You can choose from the following:

Median home prices (nationally or regionally).
Housing sales volume (number of units sold).
Mortgage interest rates.
Housing inventory or vacancy rates.
New construction starts or permits issued.
Time Period: Focus on analyzing data over a minimum of 10 years to identify long-term trends. You may also include more specific time periods such as the 2008 housing crisis, the post-pandemic housing boom, or recent fluctuations in mortgage rates.

Visualizations:  
a. Line Charts (for each time series)
Create individual line charts for each of your selected metrics, highlighting their trends over time. Be sure to clearly label axes and include important data points, such as notable economic events (e.g., the 2008 housing crash, the 2020 pandemic impact).

b. Annotations and Trendlines
Add annotations or trendlines to mark significant shifts, recessions, or policy changes that influenced the housing market.

Analysis Questions:  
What are the key trends in home prices, sales, and mortgage rates over time?
How do different metrics relate to each other (e.g., how do changes in mortgage rates affect home sales)?
Can you identify any cyclical patterns or seasonality in the data?
How did significant economic events (e.g., the 2008 financial crisis or COVID-19 pandemic) affect the housing market?

Tools: Use any data visualization tool of your choice, such as:  
Python: (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
R: (ggplot2)
Excel
Tableau or Power BI

Deliverables:  
Report (400-500 words): Analyzing the trends observed in the visualizations, interpreting the relationships between different variables, and explaining how economic events impacted the housing 



# Project 1 : Data Visualization Project on Work-from-Home vs. Back-to-Office Policies

This project focuses on an analysis of work-from-home (WFH) vs. back-to-office policies, utilizing insights from the WFH Research database. The goal is to provide a clear, data-driven view on the impacts of these policies across different industries and regions, helping us assess their long-term implications. In addition to the source mentioned here you are encouraged to use other relevant data sources on WFH.

This project will require gathering data, performing a comprehensive analysis, and creating compelling visualizations that effectively communicate key trends, benefits, and challenges associated with each work model. You have the flexibility to shape the analysis based on your findings, either supporting WFH or advocating for back-to-office policies.

Key Project Deliverables:
- Data Analysis: A thorough analysis of the WFH Research data to understand patterns, productivity metrics, employee satisfaction, and cost-efficiency.
- Visualizations: Graphs, charts, or interactive dashboards that clearly represent your findings.
- Report: A concise report summarizing the insights, supported by visual evidence.
